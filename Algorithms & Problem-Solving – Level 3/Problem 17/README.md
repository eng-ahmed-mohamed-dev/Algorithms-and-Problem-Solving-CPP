# Problem 17 – Level 3: Check if a Number Exists in a Matrix

## Problem Description
Write a program to check whether a given number exists inside a 3x3 matrix or not.
The matrix is filled with random numbers, and the user is asked to enter a number to search for.

## Solution Idea
- Generate a 3x3 matrix with random numbers.
- Print the matrix to the screen.
- Ask the user to enter a number.
- Loop through the matrix and compare each element with the given number.
- If the number is found, return true; otherwise, return false.

## Used Concepts
- 2D Arrays
- Nested Loops
- Functions
- Random Number Generation
- Boolean Logic

## Files
- `Number Exists in matrix.cpp` – C++ solution file
- `README.md` – Problem description and solution details

## Notes
- The matrix size is fixed to 3x3.
- Random numbers are generated between 0 and 10.
