# Problem 26 – Level 3  
## Upper and Lower All Letters Of a String

### Problem Description
Write a program that reads a string from the user, converts all its letters to uppercase, then converts all letters to lowercase and prints both results.

### Solution Idea
- Read a full string from the user using `getline`.
- Loop through the string and convert each character to uppercase.
- Print the uppercase result.
- Loop again and convert each character to lowercase.
- Print the lowercase result.
- Spaces are kept unchanged.

### Used Concepts
- String handling
- Loops
- `toupper()` and `tolower()`
- Functions

### Files
- `Upper and Lower All Letters Of a String.cpp`
- `README.md`

### Notes
- The program processes the same string for both upper and lower cases.
- Only letters are affected, spaces remain unchanged.
