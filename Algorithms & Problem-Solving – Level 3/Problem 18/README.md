# Problem 18 – Level 3  
Intersected Numbers in Two Matrices

## Problem Description
Write a program to print the numbers that exist in both of two given 3x3 matrices.

Each matrix is filled with random numbers, and the program should display the intersected numbers between them.

## Solution Idea
- Generate two 3x3 matrices with random numbers.
- Loop through each element in the first matrix.
- For every number, check if it exists in the second matrix.
- If the number exists in both matrices, print it.

## Used Concepts
- 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- Nested Loops
- Functions
- Random Number Generation
- Basic Searching in Arrays

## Files
- `Intersected Numbers in Matrices.cpp`

## Notes
- Duplicate numbers may appear in the output if they exist multiple times in the first matrix.
