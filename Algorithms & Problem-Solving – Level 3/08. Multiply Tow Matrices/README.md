## Problem 8 – Multiply Two Matrices

### 📝 Problem Description
Write a program to:
- Fill two 3x3 matrices with random numbers.
- Multiply the two matrices element by element.
- Store the result in a third matrix.
- Print all matrices to the screen.

---

### 🧠 Solution Idea
- Use a function to generate random numbers.
- Fill both matrices using nested loops.
- Multiply corresponding elements from both matrices.
- Store the results in a third matrix.
- Print all matrices in a clear format.

### 🛠️ Used Concepts
- 2D Arrays
- Functions
- Loops
- Random Numbers
- Matrix Operations

---

### 📂 Files
- `Multiply tow Matrices.cpp` → C++ source code that solves the problem.

---

### ▶️ Sample Output
The program prints:
- Matrix 1
- Matrix 2
- Result Matrix after multiplication

Each matrix is displayed in a readable 3x3 format.

---

### 📌 Notes
- Random numbers are generated between 1 and 10.
- The program works on fixed-size (3x3) matrices.
