# Problem 2 – Sum Each Row in Matrix

## Problem Description
Write a program to fill a 3x3 matrix with random numbers, then calculate and print the sum of each row.

## Solution Overview
In this solution, a 3x3 matrix is filled with random numbers between 1 and 100.
After displaying the matrix, the program calculates the sum of each row and prints the results.

## Implementation Details
- The matrix size is fixed to 3x3
- Random numbers are generated using `rand()`
- The matrix is filled using nested loops
- A separate function is used to calculate the sum of each row
- Output is formatted using `iomanip`
