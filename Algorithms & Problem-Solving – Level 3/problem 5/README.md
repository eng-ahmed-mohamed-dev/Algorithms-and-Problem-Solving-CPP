# Problem 5: Sum Each Column in a 3x3 Matrix

## Description
In this problem, we generate a 3x3 matrix filled with random numbers, then calculate the sum of each column and store the results in a separate array. Finally, the matrix and the column sums are printed to the console.

## Requirements
- Generate random numbers within a specific range
- Store values in a 3x3 matrix
- Calculate the sum of each column
- Save column sums in another array
- Print the matrix and the results clearly

## Concepts Used
- Arrays (2D and 1D)
- Loops
- Functions
- Random number generation

## Language
- C++
