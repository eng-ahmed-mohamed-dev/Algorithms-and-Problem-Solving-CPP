# Problem 43 – Level 3: Replace Words (Custom)

## Problem Description
Write a program that replaces words inside a string using a custom function.
The program should handle both case-sensitive and case-insensitive replacement.

## Solution Idea
The solution searches for the target word in the string and replaces it with another word.
For case-insensitive replacement, a helper function converts characters to lowercase before comparison.

## Used Concepts
- C++ strings
- Loops
- Custom functions
- Character case conversion

## Files
- Replace Words (Custom).cpp — solution implementation
- README.md — problem documentation

## Notes
The program shows how to replace words with and without matching case sensitivity.
