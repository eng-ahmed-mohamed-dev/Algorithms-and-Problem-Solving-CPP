# Problem 22 – Fibonacci Series with Recursion (Level 3)

## Problem Description
Write a program to print the Fibonacci series of 10 numbers using recursion.

The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

## Solution Idea
The solution uses a recursive function that keeps track of the previous two numbers.
In each recursive call, a new Fibonacci number is calculated, printed, and passed to the next call.
The recursion continues until the required count is reached.

## Used Concepts
- Recursion
- Functions
- Passing parameters
- Basic arithmetic operations

## Files
- `Fibonacci Series with Recursion.cpp` : Contains the solution code.
- `README.md` : Problem description and solution details.

## Notes
- Initial values are set to 0 and 1 to generate the Fibonacci sequence correctly.
- The program prints the series directly without storing it in an array.
