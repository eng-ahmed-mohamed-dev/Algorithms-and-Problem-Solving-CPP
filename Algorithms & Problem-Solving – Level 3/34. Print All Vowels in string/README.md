# Problem 34 – Level 3: Print All Vowels in String

## Problem Description
Write a program that reads a string from the user, then prints all the vowels found in that string.  
Vowels are: a, e, i, o, u (case-insensitive).

## Solution Idea
- Read the full string using `getline`.
- Loop through each character in the string.
- Convert each character to lowercase.
- Check if the character is a vowel.
- If it is, print it.

## Used Concepts
- Strings
- Functions
- Loops
- Character handling (`tolower`)
- Conditional statements

## Files
- `34. Print All Vowels in string.cpp` – C++ solution file
- `README.md` – Problem documentation

## Notes
- The program handles both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
- Vowels are printed in the same order they appear in the string.
