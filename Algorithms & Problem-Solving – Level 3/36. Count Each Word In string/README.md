- Split the string using space as a delimiter.
- Count only valid words and ignore extra spaces.
- Return the total number of words found.

## Used Concepts
- String manipulation
- Functions
- Loops
- `getline`
- `find` and `erase`

## Files
- `Count Each Word In string.cpp` : C++ source code
- `README.md` : Problem description and solution details

## Notes
- The solution handles multiple spaces between words correctly.
