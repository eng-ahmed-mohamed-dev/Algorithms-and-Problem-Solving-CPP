# Problem 15 – Level 3 | Count Number in Matrix

## Problem Description
Write a program to count how many times a given number appears in a matrix.

The program generates a 3×3 matrix with random numbers, then asks the user to enter a number and counts how many times it exists inside the matrix.

## Solution Idea
- Generate a 3×3 matrix filled with random numbers.
- Display the matrix to the user.
- Ask the user to enter a number.
- Traverse the matrix using nested loops.
- Count how many times the entered number appears.

## Used Concepts
- 2D Arrays
- Nested Loops
- Functions
- Random Number Generation
- User Input

## Files
- `Count Number in Matrix.cpp` → C++ source code
- `README.md` → Problem documentation

## Notes
- Matrix size is fixed to 3×3.
- Random numbers are generated between 1 and 10.
