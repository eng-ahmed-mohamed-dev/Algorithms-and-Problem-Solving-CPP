# Problem 27 – Invert Character Case (Level 3)

## Problem Description
Write a program that reads a single character from the user, inverts its case, and prints the result.  
If the character is uppercase, it should be converted to lowercase, and vice versa.

## Solution Idea
- Read one character from the user.
- Check if the character is uppercase or lowercase.
- Convert it to the opposite case.
- Print the converted character.

## Used Concepts
- Functions
- Character input/output
- Conditional operator
- `<cctype>` library functions (`isupper`, `tolower`, `toupper`)

## Files
- `invert_charcter_case.cpp` — C++ solution file
- `README.md` — Problem description and solution overview

## Notes
- The program assumes the input is a valid alphabetic character.
