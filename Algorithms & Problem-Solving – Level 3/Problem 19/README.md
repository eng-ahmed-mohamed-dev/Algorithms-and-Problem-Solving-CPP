# Problem 19 – Level 3: Minimum and Maximum Number in Matrix

## Problem Description
Write a program to generate a matrix with random numbers, then find and print the minimum and maximum values inside the matrix.

## Solution Idea
- Create a 3x3 matrix.
- Fill the matrix with random numbers.
- Print the matrix in a readable format.
- Traverse the matrix to find:
  - The smallest number.
  - The largest number.

## Used Concepts
- Two-dimensional arrays
- Functions
- Loops
- Random number generation
- Basic comparison logic

## Files
- `min and max Number in Matrix.cpp` : C++ source code that solves the problem.

## Notes
- The program uses fixed matrix size (3x3).
- Random numbers are generated between 0 and 100.
