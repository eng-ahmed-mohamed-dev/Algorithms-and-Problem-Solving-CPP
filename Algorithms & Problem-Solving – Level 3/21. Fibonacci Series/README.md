# Problem 21 – Fibonacci Series (Level 3)

## Problem Description
Write a program to print the Fibonacci series of 10 numbers.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 1 and 1, and each number after that is the sum of the previous two numbers.

## Solution Idea
The solution uses a loop to generate the Fibonacci numbers.
Two variables are used to store the previous two values, and a third variable stores the current Fibonacci number.
The series is printed step by step until reaching 10 numbers.

## Used Concepts
- Loops
- Functions
- Variables
- Basic arithmetic operations

## Files
- `Fibonacci Series.cpp` : C++ source code that prints the Fibonacci series.
- `README.md` : Problem description and solution overview.

## Notes
- The program prints the Fibonacci numbers directly to the console.
- The number of terms is fixed to 10.
