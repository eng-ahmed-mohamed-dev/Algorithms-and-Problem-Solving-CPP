# Problem 11 – Level 3  
Check Matrices Equality

## Problem Description
Write a program to generate two 3x3 matrices with random numbers, then check if they are equal or not.

The equality check in this problem is based on comparing the **sum of elements** in each matrix.

## Solution Idea
- Generate two matrices with random values.
- Print both matrices.
- Calculate the sum of elements for each matrix.
- Compare the two sums.
- If the sums are equal, the matrices are considered equal.

## Used Concepts
- 2D Arrays
- Functions
- Loops
- Random number generation
- Conditional statements

## Files
- `Check Matrices Equality.cpp` : Contains the solution code.
- `README.md` : Problem explanation and notes.

## Notes
- Matrix equality here depends only on the sum of elements, not element-by-element comparison.
