# Problem 1 – Random 3x3 Matrix

## Problem Description
Write a program to fill a 3x3 matrix with random numbers and display it on the screen.

## Solution Overview
In this solution, a 3x3 matrix is filled with random numbers between 1 and 100.
After filling the matrix, the values are printed in a clear matrix format.

## Implementation Details
- The matrix size is fixed to 3x3
- Random numbers are generated using `rand()`
- The matrix is filled using nested loops
- Output is formatted using `iomanip` for better readability

## Files
- `Random Matrix.cpp` → contains the full implementation of the solution
- `README.md` → explanation of the problem and solution

## Notes
This problem focuses on practicing:
- Working with 2D arrays
- Using functions to organize code
- Generating random numbers
- Printing formatted output
