# Problem 10 – Level 3  
## Sum of Matrix Elements

### Problem Description
Write a program to fill a 3x3 matrix with random numbers, then create a function that calculates and prints the sum of all elements in the matrix.

### Solution Idea
- Create a 3x3 matrix.
- Fill the matrix with random numbers between 1 and 10.
- Print the matrix in a formatted way.
- Use a separate function to calculate the sum of all matrix elements.
- Display the final sum.

### Used Concepts
- 2D Arrays
- Functions
- Loops
- Random Numbers
- Passing Arrays to Functions

### Files
- `Sum of Matrix.cpp` → C++ solution file
- `README.md` → Problem description and solution overview

### Notes
- Random numbers are generated using `rand()` seeded with current time.
- The solution is implemented using simple and clear functions.
