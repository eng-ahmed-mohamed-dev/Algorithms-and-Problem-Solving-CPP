# Algorithms & Problem-Solving (C++)

This repository contains my solutions to various problem-solving and algorithm challenges using C++.

I use this repository to practice problem solving, apply clean code principles, and track my progress over time.

## Repository Structure

Problems are organized by levels.  
Each level contains a set of solved problems, and each problem has its own folder.

- Level 1 → 50 problems
- Level 2 → 50 problems
- More levels will be added later

## Notes

- Level 1 and Level 2 were solved before I learned Git and GitHub.
- Because of that, these levels do not include written documentation or explanations.
- Clean code principles were used in all problems.
- Code quality and structure improved gradually with practice and experience.
- Newer levels will include explanations and clearer documentation.

This repository reflects my learning journey and continuous improvement.

## Language
- All solutions are written in **C++**.
